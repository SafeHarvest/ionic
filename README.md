# Ionic Setup

*Iâ€™m running late so rushing this. Will make it better later.*

1. Make sure latest NodeJS is installed. 
1. Install *global* dependencies by running `npm install -g cordova ionic`
1. Change your working directory to the app directory by running `cd SafeHarvest`
1. Install *local* dependencies by running `npm install gulp`
1. Run app in browser by running `ionic serve`
1. If the previous step fails due to SASS errors, run `ionic setup sass` and try again
